DonTheDOM
=========
=This piece of code helps you change the CSS (like firebug, chrome inspector,etc) on the fly, you need to use contents of id=DonTheDOM inside your html file along with library and css file

This app uses CSS3Utilities.js, selector.js and jquery

I have made this file out of one of the demos of CSSUtility and added some of my code

*This is a fun project. Just use the code if you wish to*
